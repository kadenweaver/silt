            "Tunic was so fun because you get to explore and try to figure out the instruction manual as you gather it and its written in a different language. Not sure if you can tell, but the game is mostly about the instruction manual.",
            "It is definitely not about the like six pretty memorable boss fights that were both challenging but so rewarding. Or the fact that your ability to explore is only limited to a certain extent, so you can be completely undereleveled in an area, but try to run past enemies and collect the special items way out of order. Oh did I mention there are items.",
            "There are in fact one or two fun items in Tunic. Like a literal shotgun. Or three different types of bombs. I have saved the best for last but there is also a frog claw. It is the best for obvious reasons.",
            "So anyways I got to the end of the game and I didn't really feel a need to play it again, but it offered me either a new game plus or to start over. And on the start over option, it said I was missing 6 pages from the manual. If I didn't need 6 of the pages to beat the game, I guess it wasn't a very good manual. But it still leaves me wondering, is the only way to collect the rest of the pages to start a new game?"
