            "After negating City's offense in the CL Final, Chelsea pose an intimidating threat going forward. They can bank on a depth of young talent reinforced by proven professionals marked by consistent quality. Despite an otherwise tumultous season end, Chelsea's light at the end of the tunnel is shining brighter than ever.",                                    
            "Homegrown starlets Mason Mount and Reece James will likely stay at the club as long as found talent Ben Chilwell, Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner, and Kai Havertz, especially since the group has proven they can succeed at the highest level.",
            "We were looking forward to this game so much that we decided to guess the Chelsea starting lineup"

            "What better way to troll Chelsea fans than to sub Kepa Arrizabalaga on for a last minute \"penalties specialist\" appearance in the UEFA Super Cup. Somehow it worked: the Spanish keeper blocked spot kicks from Aissa Mandi and Raul Albiol, almost stopping a third with a unique strategy that involved diving to his right all but once.", 
            "Hakim Ziyech's early goal wasn't enough to secure a victory for Chelsea. The Moroccan struck in the first half, arching the ball over the keeper into the opposite side of the net. Kai Havertz provided the assist after being played in brilliantly on the left side by an inspired Marcos Alonso pass.  Gerard Moreno equalized 30 minutes into the second half on a sharply worked passing play by the Spanish side. Moreno found Boulaye Dia near the goal line and made the most out of the return pass from his Senegalese teammate.",
            "What proceeded was a bizarre penalty shootout-- it certaintly started that way with Kepa's substitution late in extra time. Chelsea shot first, but fell behind immediately with a weak effort from Havertz of all players. Marcos Alonso slipped at the spot during his shot in proper John Terry nightmare fashion, and sudden death saw Toni Rudiger step up and dispatch an emphatic finish."

            "Soccer has evolved to the point where you have to hold your breath on the first day of the season, even when the opponent is Crystal Palace, even when your team has just won the Champion's League. The spirit at Chelsea is clearly one that burns brightly enough to dissapate that cloud of doubt. And with City dropping points so early in the season, there's nothing but high hopes for the Blues.", 
            "For the opening half hour this match looked like one of those stalemates caused by the smaller team's defensive ridgidity. Chelsea kept the Eagles in their own defensive third but failed to find the back of the net. I THINK Mason Mount won the freekick at the edge of the 18 that led to Chelsea's first goal. I know for a fact that I called Marcos Alonso scoring when I saw him lined up behind the ball on the right corner. That guy must practice that every single day, Vicente Guaita was left glued to the spot as he watched the free kick slam into the top right corner of his goal.",
            "Christian Pulisic struck next, falling over as his attempt skipped off of the outstretched leg of Cheikhou Kouyate and over a prone Guaita. Why is he always falling when he scores? Mount worked an incredible one-two with Azpilicueta on the right flank to open himself up for the cross that led to Pulisic's shot. We went into the locker room at half feeling positive about the result, but there's a certain saying about this type of lead. Luckily, Trevor Chalobah scored a long-raged effort on his debut to put Chelsea three ahead. What a way to start off your senior team run at the outset of a season; it's nice to see Tuchel bringing along academy players."

            "Pure heartbreak, anyways, has it been a while since I last blogged about Chelsea?", "It's tough to be mad at the current squad with everything that's happened to Chelsea in the past year. Our dream team fell apart with injuries to Reece James and Ben Chilwell, in fact, you can probably see where we lost hold of the prem shortly after they got injured.", 
            "Then you have our defeat to Liverpool in the League Cup, losing our owner due to his part in the war in Ukraine, and now this tragic defeat. Chelsea players and fans alike seem to be relishing still in this last season before...well...who knows what will happen? There's plenty to celebrate despite the hard times.","It's a mix of factors lifting Chelsea spirits, multiple reasons to stay hopeful that if just the right things happen, Chelsea might not only survive a change in ownership, but thrive through it.", 
            "For once, our position in the league seems secure, even though we dropped first place in early December. A campaign void of many losses has supported a steady view from third, from which we watch Arsenal, United, West Ham, and Tottenham claw for fourth. Touch wood, but it looks unlikely that Chelsea will have to worry about playing CL football next year, especially now that we can turn our almost complete attention to the remaining 8 matches.", 
            "This season also still represents the opportunity for silverware, with an FA Cup semifinal against Crystal Palace coming later this month. We could face a distracted Liverpool or City side in the final if we advance.",
            "Thanks to a sharp coach and world class players, Chelsea have felt like a top team this season, like the European champions we are. Next season will surely demand new players, namely some centerbacks and a left fullback, but it's a joy to watch the current Chelsea squad work their magic. If our new owners can keep our manager and some of the club's key players, I don't think anyone will forget when we took it to Real Madrid in their own stadium."

            "In terms of managers getting sacked, Thomas Tuchel's exit may qualify as one of the saddest in Chelsea history. And that's including when club legend Frank Lampard was fired just before him. Something about the mix of timing, his personality, and the expectations for not only him, but also his squad-- I think this is a rare case of Chelsea fans wanting to see a stumbling manager continue a little longer and try to reset the course.", 
            "I don't want to write Tuchel's eulogy, since it's a little silly, and because the man could return for another stint in my book. But why not introduce a little humanity into football? I'll never forget seeing a compilation of a speech Tuchel gave after joining and, of course, some selective highlights from the players thereafter. In the video, he talks about chasing City and says something like 'we must hunt them like wolves'. Simpy put, that was just the amount of passion the man seemed to have for Chelsea, and it energized fans to the max.",
            "To the manager that won us a number of trophies including the prized Champions League, thanks for everything and good luck. Hopefully we'll see you again!",
            "They say that when one door closes, another opens, and through this metaphorical open door treads Graham Potter. The ex Brighton & Hove Albion man will be expected to conjure better performances from our entire squad, let alone his former player, Marc Cucurella. The Prem-ready coach has impressed year in and year out with Brighton, bringing along an impressive lineup of underrated talent. Welcome, Graham, and best of luck to you!"

            "When Potter joined Chelsea, the move was a shock to Chelea fans to be sure, but also seemed to cause a ripple or two in the rest of the soccer world. How did the manager of an overperforming premier league team, a man whose coaching career started at university and then Östersund in Sweden, suddenly become the most expensive coach of all time. And what was it about Potter that gained him the confidence of new Chelsea owner, Todd Boehly? Or more importantly, what made the American so confident in him that it deemed replacing Tuchel?", 
            "At first, though saddened to see such a nice fellow go so quickly, the Chelsea fanbase seemed ready to embrace a new manager in charge. Potter's ninth place finish with Brighton the season before was apparently enough (I'll admit, I thought his seasons with Brighton were more consisent). After all, if Potter could squeeze the most out of Pascal Groß and Leandro Trossard, it seemed logical he would make a Caiceido or two at Chelsea.", 
            "In addition to the new manager came new players. Though Boehly's time as a quasi director of football seemed haphazardly guided at best, he brought in quality enough reinforcements through his first two transfer windows. Instead of trying to make a point about throwing darts at a board, I'll just list the major Boehly transfers so far.",
            "IN: Sterling, Koulibaly, Cucurella, Wesley Fofana, Zakaria, Aubameyang, David Fofana, Badiashille, Santos, Félix, Mudryk, Madueke, Gusto, Enzo",
            "OUT: Jorginho, Gilmour, Kenedy, Emerson, Werner",
            "Though Chelsea's recent transfer business has caused an almost complete refresh of the team, just the players brought in should constitute a very competitive side. Instead, the form of the team is at an extreme nadir. With just 3 wins in the past 16 matches, the last good memory Chelsea fans have is bossing AC Milan in both legs of the CL group stage to reserve our place in the round of 16. Since then, Potter has done little to justify his fee, and the Englishman will hope for a huge upturn in form from his players to reignite the season."

            "Hopefully the gloom and hopelessness of Chelsea comes across with this grave black flag. Times are dark for my beloved side: the manager has been replaced again, leading Didier Drogba to say he barely recognizes the club. If the savior of an entire country looks at your organization as unsalvageable, is there any hope for resurgence? The answer is a resounding yes with a flashy grin and probably a cheeky thumbs up. Super Frank is back, baby.", 
            "Assistant manager Bruno Salter took charge for a single match, a predictable tie against a partial strength Liverpool. Lampard then returned as caretaker manager and lost his first four matches in charge, including two dreadful legs against Madrid in the Champions League quarterfinals and sorry performances in the league against Wolves and Brighton. A combination of personnel and system switches made the team incoherent, to say the least.", 
            "But through the experimentation came some inkling of aspiration. In the second match against Real Madrid, the side finally seemed to be taking shape. Chelsea dazzled for the first time in a while with decisive, attacking football: service coming from wide to provide a barrage of shots. Alas, our disorganization in getting forward resulted in punishment for lack of pace and positioning in such a high defensive line. Without the venom to score any goals, we were easily swept aside by the spanish giants.", 
            "Talk of a manager search has swirled since Potter was dismissed, with Julian Nagelsmann allegedly bowing out of a race that included the Sporting boss, Rúben Amorim and former Spurs man, Mauricio Pochettino. Chelsea's scramble to turn results around has even led to anxious reports that Pochettino has already signed a deal with the club.", 
            "Whoever takes over will have an uphill battle: the squad needs to be trimmed before next season, and effective replacements will be a priority for attacking positions and players who are constantly injured. At the time of writing is Chelsea's next match against Brentford. C'mon, Chelsea!",
