            "After negating City's offense in the CL Final, Chelsea pose an intimidating threat going forward. They can bank on a depth of young talent reinforced by proven professionals marked by consistent quality. Despite an otherwise tumultous season end, Chelsea's light at the end of the tunnel is shining brighter than ever.",                                    
            "Homegrown starlets Mason Mount and Reece James will likely stay at the club as long as found talent Ben Chilwell, Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner, and Kai Havertz, especially since the group has proven they can succeed at the highest level.",
            "We were looking forward to this game so much that we decided to guess the Chelsea starting lineup"

            "What better way to troll Chelsea fans than to sub Kepa Arrizabalaga on for a last minute \"penalties specialist\" appearance in the UEFA Super Cup. Somehow it worked: the Spanish keeper blocked spot kicks from Aissa Mandi and Raul Albiol, almost stopping a third with a unique strategy that involved diving to his right all but once.", 
            "Hakim Ziyech's early goal wasn't enough to secure a victory for Chelsea. The Algerian struck in the first half, arching the ball over the keeper into the opposite side of the net. Kai Havertz provided the assist after being played in brilliantly on the left side by an inspired Marcos Alonso pass.  Gerard Moreno equalized 30 minutes into the second half on a sharply worked passing play by the Spanish side. Moreno found Boulaye Dia near the goal line and made the most out of the return pass from his Senegalese teammate.",
            "What proceeded was a bizarre penalty shootout-- it certaintly started that way with Kepa's substitution late in extra time. Chelsea shot first, but fell behind immediately with a weak effort from Havertz of all players. Marcos Alonso slipped at the spot during his shot in proper John Terry nightmare fashion, and sudden death saw Toni Rudiger step up and dispatch an emphatic finish."

            "Soccer has evolved to the point where you have to hold your breath on the first day of the season, even when the opponent is Crystal Palace, even when your team has just won the Champion's League. The spirit at Chelsea is clearly one that burns brightly enough to dissapate that cloud of doubt. And with City dropping points so early in the season, there's nothing but high hopes for the Blues.", 
            "For the opening half hour this match looked like one of those stalemates caused by the smaller team's defensive ridgidity. Chelsea kept the Eagles in their own defensive third but failed to find the back of the net. I THINK Mason Mount won the freekick at the edge of the 18 that led to Chelsea's first goal. I know for a fact that I called Marcos Alonso scoring when I saw him lined up behind the ball on the right corner. That guy must practice that every single day, Vicente Guaita was left glued to the spot as he watched the free kick slam into the top right corner of his goal.",
            "Christian Pulisic struck next, falling over as his attempt skipped off of the outstretched leg of Cheikhou Kouyate and over a prone Guaita. Why is he always falling when he scores? Mount worked an incredible one-two with Azpilicueta on the right flank to open himself up for the cross that led to Pulisic's shot. We went into the locker room at half feeling positive about the result, but there's a certain saying about this type of lead. Luckily, Trevor Chalobah scored a long-raged effort on his debut to put Chelsea three ahead. What a way to start off your senior team run at the outset of a season; it's nice to see Tuchel bringing along academy players."

            "Pure heartbreak, anyways, has it been a while since I last blogged about Chelsea?", "It's tough to be mad at the current squad with everything that's happened to Chelsea in the past year. Our dream team fell apart with injuries to Reece James and Ben Chilwell, in fact, you can probably see where we lost hold of the prem shortly after they got injured.", 
            "Then you have our defeat to Liverpool in the League Cup, losing our owner due to his part in the war in Ukraine, and now this tragic defeat. Chelsea players and fans alike seem to be relishing still in this last season before...well...who knows what will happen? There's plenty to celebrate despite the hard times.","It's a mix of factors lifting Chelsea spirits, multiple reasons to stay hopeful that if just the right things happen, Chelsea might not only survive a change in ownership, but thrive through it.", 
            "For once, our position in the league seems secure, even though we dropped first place in early December. A campaign void of many losses has supported a steady view from third, from which we watch Arsenal, United, West Ham, and Tottenham claw for fourth. Touch wood, but it looks unlikely that Chelsea will have to worry about playing CL football next year, especially now that we can turn our almost complete attention to the remaining 8 matches.", 
            "This season also still represents the opportunity for silverware, with an FA Cup semifinal against Crystal Palace coming later this month. We could face a distracted Liverpool or City side in the final if we advance.",
            "Thanks to a sharp coach and world class players, Chelsea have felt like a top team this season, like the European champions we are. Next season will surely demand new players, namely some centerbacks and a left fullback, but it's a joy to watch the current Chelsea squad work their magic. If our new owners can keep our manager and some of the club's key players, I don't think anyone will forget when we took it to Real Madrid in their own stadium."
