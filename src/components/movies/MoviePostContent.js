      "Just like I used to rewind VHS tapes as a kid, let's go back to the start of a life in movies. My relationship with movies begins with the same 6 options, the most memorable of which were Jurassic Park (1993) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990). To this day I have etched in my mind the images of the velociraptor looking through the kitchen door window and Michelangelo doing his 'You dirty rat' Cagney impression. I was lucky enough to later get Pokémon: The First Movie (1989) and Digimon: The Movie (2000), animated masterpieces in their day. Any other movie I watched was on a three-day VHS rental from the grocery store or at the theater.",
      "The next big scene is set in Philadelphia, where I went to stay with Luke before I attended The Hill School. He caught me watching the Harry Potter movies I had recently acquired (through totally legal means, of course) on my new computer. Bless his heart, he took it upon himself right then and there to open my eyes to the wider world of film. He introduced me to Korean cinema and Stanley Kubrick, eventually constructing 'The List' as a guide of good movies for a bored guy with virtually limitless access to movies (again, in a completely legal sense). I'll be sure to include The List document in a future post, along with all of its included bar graphs and pictures of Beyoncé.",
      "The List carried me through to college, where I decided to enroll in some film classes. I stuck with Professor Papson from intro courses to electives, he was a real Mensch who taught about everything film, from Realism to Formalism, in the coolest way. I have distinct memories of sitting in a dark classroom in Hepburn Hall, watching movie clips on a projector board.  One of my final classes with Steve was a review of Refn, Tarantino, and Kim Ki-duk called Edgy Cinema. Writing papers on Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Drive (2011) was no easier than any other research, but it definitely felt more intellectually rewarding.",
      "Fast forward to today, Madi and I are tackling an IMDB top 250 list with lots to look to forward to. We often went to the theater when we lived in DC, to Landmark's E Street or Atlantic Plumbing. We hardly missed when we went, and one year we started a tradition of both watching Miyazaki titles during Studio Ghibli Fest and attempting to see the suite of award-nominated films for a given season. Princess Mononoke (1997) and Little Women (2019) stand out among fine company. We watched Isle of Dogs (2018) from the far row of the theater, it was as uncomfortable as it sounds but took nothing away from our appreciation for the movie. Our award tradition continued this year in Hawaii, where we watched Past Lives (2023) and Anatomy of a Fall (2023).",
      "Now that we have a little background out of the way, let's get watching!",
