Many of the tracks from the original album are lively and intricately woven, my favorite being "On The Floor". Two of the better tracks off the ensuing remix album are A.G. Cook\'s light, static take on "Describe", and this bouncy rhythm switch for "Without You".',

It's a pretty weak song but I do like that they used a volume wobble through the entirety of the track, it invokes a crystal like hollowness. Hold on, I just found out Cartier God is a SoundCloud producer, does that make Bladee a SoundCloud rapper? Sad Boys 4 lyfe.",

      'Vince Staples is a rare example of an artist that has plenty of powerful singles without having released a solid album. I first started listening to him with the track "Norf Norf" from his debut album, Summertime \'06. The California native introduced himself there with a unique identity, something he maintained through his subsequent works. Memorable opening lines like "Bitch, you thirsty? Please, grab a Sprite" and clear allusions to his adolescence in Long Beach would stick from there on out.',
      'These elements hinted at a rapper with great potential:  someone who has a story to tell, but doesn\'t take themselves seriously enough to shy away from the corny side of rap. What followed was a couple of club singles and not much else. Staples released "Big Fish" and "FUN!", two colossal hits that still let him down in terms of overall acclaim. I watched Vince open for Tyler, the Creator in February of 2018, soon thereafter the rapper started a pity party GoFundMe to address criticisms of his live performances. Other tracks like "745" and "Yeah Right" weren\'t enough to supplement his hits, and his delivery in concert was lackluster at best.',
      'In the three years since his last album, Staples has clearly dedicated more time than ever to his eponymous work. With producer Kenny Beats drafting a somber yet curious soundscape for the album, Staples rhymes with an experienced certainty, detailing his life from a more mature perspective. "This is another take on myself that I might not have had before," claims the Long Beach native. With the help of Beats, as well as vocals from producer Reske and singer Fousheé, he can be confident that this will stand as his most complete work yet.',

      "Not much is known about John Glacier save her online persona. The artist boasts no Wikipedia page, and only one interview pops up on Google. The rest is left to be interpreted from her SoundCloud and Instagram accounts. Nevertheless, Glacier is an exciting prospect in the music world. The UK artist is supposed to release an upcoming collaboration with producer Vegyn, whose signature muffled touch also appears on Icing. Together they should combine to create plenty of Bedroom Hop, a play on the pop genre made popular in the late 2010s, characterized by lofi production and overprocessed sounds.",

      "It seemed like just last year Caroline Polachek had graduated from anonymous Chairlift band member to full fledged pop goddess, blessing us with her album Pang and the iconic music video for 'So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings'. Well that DID happen last year, but Caroline is already at it again with her new single, 'Bunny Is A Rider'. The music video picks up right where 'So Hot' left off, cryptically portraying Caroline in a maze of boxes, evading a minotaur like creature with a teleportation device.",

      "My first Ives encounter was on her freshman effort, Icing on the Cake, which undoubtedly holds up, but seemed as though it could be a one off dance hit from a budding artist. The richness of her sound has expanded meteorically-- on Janky Star she mastered not only the driving force of the dance notes, but also the aura of the spaces in between.",
      "On a record where it's clear she collects inspiration from many different sources-- her voice cutting with Lana-like silkiness, lighthearted indie pop production rem·i·nis·cent of Passion Pit, LCD, The New Pornographers --she also brings a defined personality and offbeat swagger that demand appreciation.",
      "Her music videos sometimes don't have a quality option beyond 480p. I think that sums it up pretty well.",

      "One fateful day I opened YouTube on my phone and was suggested the video for Magdalena Bay's 'Dreamcatching'. The recommended video didn't have many views at the time, but I was intrigued by the thumbnail: a faun-esque woman's face stared back, surrounded by wisps of paint. I clicked play and my life is better for it.",
      "What unfolded was a spectacular journey through AI generated landscapes, accompanied by a dark yet driving melody-- in an effort to do the work proper justice, I've included it below for your personal viewing. From here I fell hard into the gravity of Magdalena Bay, 'Killshot' was my next view into this mercurial world, and from there I found more tracks I loved: 'Secrets', 'Chaeri', and 'You Lose!'.",
      "With each new track came a synth interpretation of another genre: 'Killshot' and 'Secrets' come off as quirky, funk throwaways, but 'Chaeri' is something of a digitized ballad, and 'You Lose!' sounds as though it could be from a remastered Yeah Yeah Yeahs or Silversun Pickups album.",
      "And that's exactly what's so exciting about Magdalena Bay: the diversity of sound. Imagining their range, combined with the guest features and skill that come with a more seasoned musical career, Mag Bay clearly have the potential to define pop for years to come.",
